# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. By analyzing a dataset of past transactions, this project builds models to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, helping in early fraud detection.

## Overview
Credit card fraud is a serious problem, leading to significant financial losses worldwide. This project applies machine learning techniques to predict fraudulent transactions based on transaction details and anomaly patterns. The project explores data processing, visualization, and classification algorithms to detect fraud effectively.

## Prerequisites
To run this notebook, youâ€™ll need the following packages: Python 3.x numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Usage
Load and Explore Data: Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, detect class imbalance, and visualize features. Preprocess Data: Scale features as required and split the data into training and test sets. Model Training: Train various classifiers, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. Model Evaluation: Use evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC curve) to assess model performance and select the best model for fraud detection.

## Results
The notebook provides a summary of model performance metrics. You can review the confusion matrix, ROC-AUC curves, and other relevant metrics to compare model effectiveness. The most accurate model can then be used in production settings for real-time fraud detection.
